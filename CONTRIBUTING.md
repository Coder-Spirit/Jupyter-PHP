Jupyter-PHP Contributing Guidelines
====================================

Contributing with Code
----------------------

In first place, if you want to contribute code to Jupyter-PHP, you must have installed PHP, preferably recent
versions (PHP>=5.5, but recommended PHP>=7.0).

If you don't know where to start, you can try searching inside the
[issues list](https://github.com/Litipk/Jupyter-PHP/issues). Specially the ones marked with the
[help wanted](https://github.com/Litipk/Jupyter-PHP/labels/help%20wanted) tag.

Some extra advices related on good practices:
 * We try to follow the PSR standards, in special **PSR-1**, **PSR-2** and **PSR-4**.
 * Every new added feature should come with unit tests, stability and code correctness is an important priority of this project.


Contributing with Documentation
-------------------------------

If you want to contribute documentation, you're welcome! :) , BUT, actually the documentation is pretty bad, and it's perfectly
undersandable that this task isn't very attractive.

Contributing with Bug Reports
-----------------------------

A very important part of every software project is the bugs tracking and solving process. You can send us bug reports through
the [tracker](https://github.com/Litipk/Jupyter-PHP/issues).

It's desirable that every bug report explains the bug in a way that the developers can easily reproduce it. The following points
are very helpful in order to achieve reproducibility:
* Example code.
* Jupyter version
* Jupyter-PHP version.
* Python version
* PHP version

Contributing with New Ideas
---------------------------

You can use the github [tracker](https://github.com/Litipk/Jupyter-PHP/issues) to send us new ideas, even if those ideas aren't
bug reports. In such case, adding something like "SUGGESTION: ...", "IMPROVEMENT: ..." to the report bug it's a good idea.

You can also discuss your ideas with us in our [Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/Litipk/Jupyter-PHP).
