## Introduction

**Jupyter-PHP** is a PHP kernel for [*Jupyter*](http://jupyter.org). This project is inspired on
[https://github.com/dawehner/jupyter-php](https://github.com/dawehner/jupyter-php), some bits of code from the old
*IPython* kernel have been used in this new *Jupyter* kernel.

In addition to the Jupyter compatibility, the new Jupyter-PHP adds a lot of improvements, like the integration with
[PsySH](http://psysh.org/) in order to provide:

  * *"memory"*: the old kernel was unable to keep variables to allow reuse them later.
  * online documentation with the `doc` command. *Not yet implemented*
  * code introspection with the `ls` command. *Not yet implemented*
  * errors introspection with the `wtf` command. *Not yet implemented*

## Getting started

The recommended way is to go to the [*Jupyter-PHP installer*'s page](https://litipk.github.io/Jupyter-PHP-Installer/)
and follow its instructions.
